**To use `bluesky.json`, the `format` property should be `source`.**

This file uses version 3 of the JSON rule-set format. `Bluesky` in the example is an existing outbound tag; replace it as needed.

### Example

```json
{
  "route": {
    "rule_set": [
      {
        "type": "remote",
        "tag": "bluesky",
        "format": "source",
        "url": "https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/Paloexiz/blacklist-rules@main/artifact/other/sing-box/bluesky/bluesky.json",
        "update_interval": "24h"
      }
    ],
    "rules": [
      {
        "rule_set": [
          "bluesky"
        ],
        "outbound": "Bluesky"
      }
    ]
